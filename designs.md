# Experimental Designs

An experimental design describes the characteristics of each sample as relevant to the analysis of the data. Our curation team is responsible for annotating each sample in Gemma, recording our interpretation of the essential features of the design for each data set. Where possible our curation reflects the intent of the experimenters as indicated in their GEO submission and/or publication.

An experimental design is organized around **Experimental Factors** (EF). A factor is a known variable in an experiment, such as "age", "genotype" or "treatment". An experiment can have any number of factors, but most have only 1-3.

Each sample has a specific **Factor Value** for each Factor. For example, for "genotype", the available values might be "wild-type" and "mutant". For a parameter like "age", the values might be continuous values (numbers) like "10.1 years".

Because experimental designs are curated manually by our team, errors can occur. If you spot a problem, please let us know.
