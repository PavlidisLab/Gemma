		<p>
			The fields in the probe browser have tooltips. Hold the cursor over column headings in tables to see them.
		</p>

		<p>
			Probes are listed in the main table at the bottom of the page. Click on a row to see the details. Links are provided to
			get details about genes.
		<p>
			The probe browser operates in two similar modes, depending on how you reach the page:
		</p>
		<ul>

			<li>
				Probes-for-gene mode - The probes for one gene are shown. The platform for each probe is listed in a separate column
				in the bottom table. In this mode all probes will be shown in the table (usually not more than a few hundred).
			</li>
			<li>
				Probes-on-platform mode - For viewing probes for one platform (e.g. array design). When the page loads, only a subset of the
				probes will be shown. Use the search functionality to find specific probes. You can search by gene or probe id.
			</li>
		</ul>
