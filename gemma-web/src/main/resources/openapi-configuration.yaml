    title: Gemma RESTful API
    version: 2.6.0
    description: |
      This website documents the usage of the [Gemma RESTful API](https://gemma.msl.ubc.ca/rest/v2/). Here you can find
      example script usage of the API, as well as graphical interface for each endpoint, with description of its
      parameters and the endpoint URL.

      Use of this webpage and the Gemma Web services, including the REST API, is subject to [these terms and conditions](https://pavlidislab.github.io/Gemma/terms.html).
      Please read these in full before continuing to use this webpage or any other part of the Gemma system.

      Fix return type for `getResultSets` which was incorrectly referring to a renamed VO.

      Annotate all possible types for `SearchResult.resultObject`. This incidentally includes the `GeneSetValueObject`
      in the specification which is not exposed elsewhere in the API.

      ## Updates

      ### Update 2.6.0

      Add a new `externalDatabases` attribute to the main endpoint that displays version of some of the main external
      databases that we are using. This exposes versions and last updates for genomes, gene annotations, GO terms, and
      much more!

      The `ExternalDatabaseValueObject` now exposes a `description` which provides additional details.

      ### Update 2.5.2

      Restore `factors` in `BioMaterialValueObject` as it is being still used by our RNA-Seq pipeline. The attribute is
      deprecated and should not be used and will be removed when we find a suitable alternative.

      Introduce a new endpoint to retrieve quantitation types for a given dataset and parameters to retrieve expression
      data by quantitation type to `getDatasetProcessedExpression` and `getDatasetRawExpression`. As it was too difficult
      to extends `getDatasetExpression` to also support quantitation type while retaining the filter feature, we decided
      to deprecate it and reintroduce filtering for both raw and processed expression in the future.

      ### Update 2.5.1

      Restore `objectClass` visibility in `AnnotationValueObject`.

      Fix incorrect response types for annotations search endpoints returning datasets.

      ### Update 2.5.0

      Major cleanups were performed in this release in order to stabilize the specification. Numerous properties from
      Gemma Web that were never intended to be exposed in Gemma REST have been hidden. It's a bit too much to describe
      in here, but you can navigate to the schemas section below to get a good glance at the models.

      Favour `numberOfSomething` instead of `somethingCount` which is clearer. The older names are kept for
      backward-compatibility, but should be considered deprecated.

      Gene aliases and multifunctionality rank are now filled in `GeneValueObject`.

      Uniformly use `TaxonValueObject` to represent taxon. This is breaking change for the `ExpressionExperimentValueObject`
      and `ArrayDesignValueObject` as their `taxon` property will be an `object` instead of a `string`. Properties such
      as `taxonId` are now deprecated and `taxon.id` should be used instead.

      Entities that have IDs now all inherit from `IdentifiableValueObject`. This implies that you can assume the
      presence of an `id` in a search result `resultObject` attribute for example.

      New `/search` endpoint! for an unified search experience. Annotation-based search endpoints under `/annotations`
      are now deprecated.

      New API docs! While not as nice looking, the previous theme will be gradually ported to Swagger UI as we focused
      on functionality over prettiness for this release.

      ### Update 2.4.0 through 2.4.1

      Release notes for the 2.4 series were not written down, so I'll try to do my best to recall features that were
      introduced at that time.

      An [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification was introduced and available under `/rest/v2/openapi.json`,
      although not fully stabilized.

      Add a `/resultSets` endpoint to navigate result sets directly, by ID or by dataset.

      Add a `/resultSets/{resultSetId}` endpoint to retrieve a specific result set by its ID. This endpoint can be
      negotiated with an `Accept: text/tab-separated-values` header to obtain a TSV representation.

      Add a `/datasets/{dataset}/analyses/differential/resultSets` endpoint that essentially redirect to a specific
      `/resultSet` endpoint by dataset ID.

      Add an endpoint to retrieve preferred raw expression vectors.

      ### Update 2.3.4

      November 6th, 2018

      November 6th [2.3.4] Bug fixes in the dataset search endpoint.

      November 5th [2.3.3] Added filtering parameters to dataset search.

      October 25th [2.3.2] Changed behavior of the dataset search endpoint to more closely match the Gemma web interface.

      October 2nd [2.3.1] Added group information to the User value object.

      September 27th [2.3.0] Breaking change in Taxa: Abbreviation property has been removed and is therefore no longer
      an accepted identifier.

      ### Update 2.2.6

      June 7th, 2018

      Code maintenance, bug fixes. Geeq scores stable and made public.

      June 7th [2.2.6] Added: User authentication endpoint.

      May 2nd [2.2.5] Fixed: Cleaned up and optimized platforms/elements endpoint, removed redundant information
      (recursive properties nesting).

      April 12th [2.2.3] Fixed: Array arguments not handling non-string properties properly, e.g. `ncbiIds` of genes.

      April 9th [2.2.1] Fixed: Filter argument not working when the filtered field was a primitive type. This most
      significantly allows filtering by geeq boolean and double properties.

      ### Update 2.2.0

      February 8th, 2018

      Breaking change in the 'Dataset differential analysis' endpoint:
      - No longer using `qValueThreshold` parameter.
      - Response format changed, now using `DifferentialExpressionAnalysisValueObject` instead of `DifferentialExpressionValueObject`
      - [Experimental] Added Geeq (Gene Expression Experiment Quality) scores to the dataset value objects
