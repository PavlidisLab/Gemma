# Programmatic use of Gemma

Gemma has a RESTful API, documented  **[here](https://gemma.msl.ubc.ca/resources/restapidocs/)**. There you will find all necessary information on how to interact with gemma
programatically. 

However, most users will find more convenient programmatic access to Gemma's data and analyses via <a href="https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.gemma.R">gemma.R</a> (R/Bioconductor)
 and <a href="https://github.com/PavlidisLab/gemmapy">gemmapy</a> (Python).

The R and Python packages offer similar functionality and have their own documentation and examples/vignettes. For convenience we have 
gathered some examples in both languages **[here](R-python-examples.html)**.
