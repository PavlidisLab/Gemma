# Programmatic use of Gemma

Gemma has a RESTful API, documented here. There you will find all necessary information on how to interact with gemma programatically.

However, most users will find more convenient programmatic access to Gemma's data and analyses via gemma.R (R/Bioconductor) and gemmapy (Python).

The R and Python packages offer similar functionality and have their own documentation and examples/vignettes. For convenience we have gathered some examples in both languages here.
