# Gene Expression Experiment Quality (Geeq)

Geeq is Gemma's method of giving users an indicator of dataset quality. Our definition of "quality" refers to data quality, wherein the same study could have been done twice with the same technical parameters and in one case yield bad quality data, and in another high quality data.

The quality scores are calculated based on several factors deemed reflective of dataset quality, such as the presence of batch confounds.

On the Gemma website, we use colored emoticons to give intuitive visual representation of both the quality and suitability scores. In most places, hovering over the emoticon will reveal the numerical value of the score.
