First, all sequences were RepeatMasked to remove repetitive elements.  Next, sequence identity between individual sequences was established using pairwise BLAT or BLAST  and sim4.  The results from single-linkage clustering were further triaged to produce a final target set of 44,775 targets with the highest degree of confidence of computational prediction (biasing toward sequences containing Interpro domains and away from non-coding RNAs).  Finally, the human sequence set was pruned of all targets already represented on Affymetrix’s commercially available U133A array, leaving 22,645 target sequences for our custom array.  The final target sets were submitted to the Affymetrix's chip design pipeline for fabrication of the GNF1H arrays. Note that only 11406 have sequences given.	1	0
