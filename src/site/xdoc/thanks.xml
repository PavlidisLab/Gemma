					We are indebted to the many researchers who have made data publicly available. Lists of published
					papers that relate to the data included in gemma are available
					<a href="/Gemma/bibRef/showAllEeBibRefs.html">here</a> 
					and <a href="/Gemma/bibRef/searchBibRefs.html">here</a>
					. If your data is in Gemma, and your paper is not listed, please
					<a href="mailto:gemma@chibi.ubc.ca">let us know</a>

				</p>
				<p>
					Gemma obtains most data from the
					<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">Gene Expression Omnibus</a>
					with an increasing contribution from
					<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/">ArrayExpress</a>
					. We are grateful for the curation efforts at those sites, and the technical assistance we've
					received. We'd like to especially thank Tanya Barrett (NCBI) for answering many questions about GEO.
